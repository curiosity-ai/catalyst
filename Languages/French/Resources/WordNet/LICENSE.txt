<div class="notice">
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>
This
Agreement is a Free Software
license agreement that is the result of 
discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
the two main principles guiding its drafting:</p>

<ul>
<li> firstly,
compliance with the principles governing the distribution of Free Software:
access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
</li>
<li>
secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it is
conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
both authors and holders of the economic rights over software. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>The
authors of the 


CeCILL-C<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
license are:</p> 

<p>Commissariat
à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public
scientific, technical and industrial research establishment, having its
principal place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015
Paris, France.</p>

<p>Centre

<div class="preamble">
<h2>Preamble</h2>






<p>
The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the
right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.  
</p>
<p>
The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make
available to the community the modifications made to the source code of the
software so as to contribute to its evolution.  
</p>


<p>In consideration of access to
the source code and the rights to copy,
modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
with a limited warranty and the
software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the
successive licensors only have limited liability.
</p>

<p>In
this respect, 
the risks
associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or
reproducing the software by the user 
are brought to the user's attention,
given its  Free Software 
status, 
which may make it
complicated to use, 
with the result that its use is 
reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth 
computer knowledge. 
Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability of the
software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of
their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and
operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely
reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no 
provisions are either added or removed
herefrom.</p> 

<p>This
Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
the economic rights decides to submit the use
thereof to its provisions.</p>
